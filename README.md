# __*Weather Application*__

## __Description__
This application accepts the user inupted city, state, and country. Using this link for the weather API, it locates the latitude and longitude of that location to find the weather, using a different function on that same site.
The app then outputs the weather forecast, along with an appropriate icon, taken from a csv file titled icons.csv. 

## __Application Layout__
Using HTML and Bootstrap for aesthetics, the page looks as follows: it has a blue background with the title "Weather App". Underneath are three textboxes, each with a placeholder of "city," "state," and "country," respectively.
After the "Find" button, located underneath the textboxes, is pressed, the "main weather forecast" followed by its description is displayed: under that the appropriate image, and under the image, the temperature in degrees Fareheit is displayed. 

### __Usage__
To use it, open the webpage and enter the city, state (if there is no state, ie- it is in a country that doesn't have states, re-enter the city in the state's place). Press the "find" button, and the weather forecast, with a picture and description should appear.
